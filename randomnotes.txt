{==} serves as a boolean logic argument (for example {0 == 1} would output "False")
learn more about it next week apparently

vim commands:
you enter first in command mode
	:q = quit
	:w = write (save changes you made to the file)
	:wq = write (save) and then quit
	:q! = quit without writing (saving)
	:set number = sets numbers on the side of the text (nice for organization)
	i = enter insert mode (now you can actually edit the text)
	(while in insert mode) ESC = exit insert mode
	dd = delete # number of lines of text, starting from the line bar is hovering over (just doing dd deletes the line you're currently on; you don't need a number in front
	u = undo
	Ctrl + R = redo
	/(text) = search for (text); don't include parantheses (like ctrl f); pressing lowercase n scrolls through the matches downwards, pressing uppercase N goes upwards.
	:%/(search)/(replace)/gc = searches for text (search), replaces it with (replace). g makes sure this run through every match in the search, while c makes it so that a confirm prompt comes up (removing the c results in an autoconfirm, so be careful) - i.e. just doing g replaces all matching text. also, including the % is important, i dunno why, but keep it in there

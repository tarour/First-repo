1. What are 3-5 (or more) commands that you can use on terminal and what do they do? What language is your computer terminal in?
ls [filepath] - list the contents of your current directory (or that of [filepath])
cd [filepath] - change your directory to [filepath]
mv [filepath1] [filepath2] - move [filepath1] to [filepath2]. (This can also be used to rename a file.)
mkdir [filepath] - Make a new directory with name [filepath]
My computer terminal language is bash.

2. Do you have pets? What kind?
I don't have any ;-;

3. If you run across an error, what would your first course of action be?
Read the error message; and if I don't understand it, look it up

4. Funniest thing that happened to you in high school.
My friends tricked me into eating snacks that were several years expired. (I didn't realize until one cracker in - and by then it was too late. I don't think my stomach has forgiven me since.)

5. What is a python script? (Keep it simple)
A file containing text that python reads (i.e. a python file)


Note: In this assignment I cloned the given repository in the repository I created, since I thought it simplified the process of copying this questions file. In hindsight I probably should have cloned the repository in a different directory. As a result I've removed the homework2 repository from my computer, and just kept the questions file, just so that the homework2 repository isn't committed to my own repo when I push it.
Edit: I forgot to answer the last part of the first question (asking what the language of the terminal is), hence my resubmission.
